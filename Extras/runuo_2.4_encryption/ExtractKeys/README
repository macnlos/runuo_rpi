**NOTE: Calculate Login Key.exe no longer works for clients higher than 6.x.x, so 7.x.x does not work.

If you want to update the table of keys in your Configuration.cs without 
waiting for third parties, you can use the tool provided here.

It should work with any client version that is using the current encryption scheme
(which hasn't changed since version 2.0.4). 

It has been tested with client versions 2.0.4, 4.0.4 and 5.0.1.

To run the tool, open a command prompt and use the following command from within 
this directory:

ExtractKeys "C:\Program Files\Ultima Online\client.exe"

You have to insert the correct path to your client.
The output should look something like this:

Client Size: 2031616
Found client keys: 0x2eaba7ec, 0xa2417e7f.

In this case, the line for your Configuration.cs would be:

new LoginKey("5.0.1", 0x2eaba7ec, 0xa2417e7f),

Where 5.0.1 is used to identify the key pair on the console.
